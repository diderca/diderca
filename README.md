ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Sahadat 

I am a passionate software engineer with a strong technology background. I try to understand the macro picture while I work on the specific deliverables of any assignment. I am known to bring reliability and peace of mind in problem solving. I believe in team ownership of systems and projects,  from the definition of  the vision to  to the  prioritization of projects, helping with the different services required in between. I can lead projects or work as a team player in collaboration and support of others to build the best-in-class software solutions to address the clients needs. I make sure that every detail is taken care of while focusing on efficiency.

In my 10 years of professional software development experience, I worked on many complex projects including developing internal tools for both the world largest marine insurance company based in New York and a major e-commerce retailer backend system based in Montreal. I contributed to all aspects of the projects as a team leader, including design, implementation, refactoring, automated testing, deployment, and uptime of the services. I played a major role in the development of key libraries, services, and tools within the company ecosystem. I tried to make my team members shine and helped them grow as engineers through code reviews, pairing and mentoring. 

As founder of  Daffodil Information Technology, I am leading a highly motivated and extremely talented team of engineers on both  backend and frontend services with quality, performance and scale in mind at every step of the way. We optimize the development costs with our workforce support in south east Asia.

We work as catalyst in the transformation of new ideas into scalable web applications. We seek efficiency by striving to reduce existing manual processes by automation or by optimizing existing softwares. We propose and deliver performance optimization, improvements, and enhancements on software architecture design and database. We prepare demo proof of concept and propose minimum viable product (MVP)  and work from there as required with long term roadmaps  and cost estimates.  All in all, we try to bring you more than you expect !
